Exclude patterns start with exclamation mark `!`.\nExample: `**/*.java, **/*.html, !**\\test\\**\\XYZ*`\n\n#### Pattern Syntax\nA given directory is recursively scanned for all files and directories. Each file/directory is matched against a set of selectors, including special support for matching against filenames with include and exclude patterns. Only files/directories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list, and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list will be placed in the list of files/directories found.\n\nWhen no list of include patterns is supplied, `**` will be used, which means that everything will be matched. When no list of exclude patterns is supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded.\n\nThe filename pattern matching is done as follows:\nThe name to be matched is split up in path segments. A path segment is the name of a directory or file, which is bounded by a path separator (forward or back slashes can be used).\nFor example, `abc/def/ghi/xyz.java` is split up in the segments `abc`, `def`, `ghi` and `xyz.java`. The same is done for the pattern against which it should be matched.\n\nThe segments of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other. When `**` is used for a path segment in the pattern, it matches zero or more path segments of the name.\n\nWhen a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the following special characters can be used:\n- `*` matches zero or more characters\n- `?` matches one character.\t\n####Examples\n- `**\\*.class` matches all `.class` files/dirs in a directory tree.\n- `test\\a??.java` matches all files/dirs which start with an `a`, then two more characters and then `.java`, in a directory called `test`.\n- `**` matches everything in a directory tree.\n- `**\\test\\**\\XYZ*` matches all files/dirs which start with `XYZ` and where there is a parent directory called `test` (e.g. `abc\\test\\def\\ghi\\XYZ123`).",
